# opioid-mortality-correlation-analysis
After reading a CDC article titled "Understanding Drug Overdoses and Deaths," I became deeply curious about whether the availability of opioids in a community could explain the rising number of deaths linked to them.

To investigate, I gathered and combined years of opioid shipment data across Pennsylvania with county-level mortality records. The data came from different sources and was organized differently, so I spent significant time cleaning it, to create a reliable, unified dataset.

When it came to modeling, I knew a simple approach wouldn’t capture the full story. For example, some large providers might sell many pills, but those pills could contain less opioid concentration. Others might be new to the market, skewing raw numbers. To address this, I considered multiple measures: total quantities, number of transactions, and morphine milligram equivalents (MME), which reflects opioid strength. By examining trends in these metrics alongside mortality rates over time, I could better identify meaningful patterns rather than misleading spikes.

Using this approach, I built statistical models that showed how key distributors’ market shares helped explain nearly 20% of the differences in death rates across counties. This strong link, despite the complexity of the crisis, suggests opioid availability is a significant factor.

This project fueled my passion for digging beyond surface-level data, asking tough questions, and finding insights that could support better decisions around public health.
