# opioid-mortality-correlation-analysis
The goal of this project is to use machine learning and statistics to see if theres a strong corelation between opioid availability and mortality rates in the state of Pennsylvania. There has been a marked rise in drug overdose related deaths and combined with an increase in drug availability, it makes a compelling case to find out this correlation.

To come up with data based conclusions, I am doing analysis on ungrouped, large opioid datasets recording opioid transaction data.
